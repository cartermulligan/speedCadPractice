# speedCadPractice
was watching a speedCad video and wanted to see if I could complete it as well. Watched maybe 30 seconds of footage from the video that I will link below and referenced the cad drawings to use for inspiration as to how to tackle the challenge. Took some ideas from the two runners but overall completed the challenge based around my knowledge. Another key difference was that the runners were using SW (solidworks) while I used autodesk fusion so while the fundamental ideas we shared were the same, the knowledge of the software was different.
